# Ascii Graph

This is a simply wrap of graph-easy, an ascii graph generator.

Two commands:

- ascii_graph_file:   Translate your current active view into an ascii graph.

- ascii_graph_region: Translate your current selection into an ascii graph.

This plug-in will not work unless you install graph-easy.

Install Instructions:

Future Plan:
- add "--jpg", "--png" options.
